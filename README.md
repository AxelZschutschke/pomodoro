# Time for tomatoes!

Not caring for color support of your terminal and other error handling!

Logs are stored in csv format, if you like to evaluate your time spent later. You fire up the script for each pomodoro session, consider taking breaks in between.

Useage:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 pomodoro.py -h
usage: pomodoro [-h] [-interval INTERVAL] [-task TASK] [-log LOG]

options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -interval INTERVAL  interval minutes [default=15]
  -task TASK          title for this pomodoro
  -log LOG            output file
```
